  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/img1.jpg
  - assets/img2.jpg
  - assets/img3.jpg
  - assets/img4.jpg
  - assets/img5.jpg
  - assets/img6.jpg
  - assets/img7.jpg
  - assets/img8.jpg
  - assets/img9.jpg
  - assets/img10.jpg
  - assets/avatars/avatar-1.jpg
  - assets/avatars/avatar-2.jpg
  - assets/avatars/avatar-3.jpg
  - assets/avatars/avatar-4.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Myriad
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROBOLD.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROBOLDCOND.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROBOLDCONDIT.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROBOLDIT.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROCOND.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROCONDIT.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MyriadProLight.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROREGULAR.OTF
        - asset: fonts/MYRIADPROSEMIBOLD.OTF
